- enable FXP to allow backing up on a different ftp-server

- make use of ~/.netrc

- take care of permissions

- make script configurable using ~/.ftpbackuprc

- signal handling (clean up temporary directory, when interrupted)

- enable different storage methods. We are already using rsync, so how
  backing up to an rsync server?


# Resolved items (hopefully ;)
use gpg to encrypt files locally
use rsync for hardlinking with backup directory
parse ftp-URI for username/password
