ftpbackup 0.4

ftpbackup is a perlscript that lets you backup your data from an ftp host.

To run, you need perl (obviously), any recent version should do, at least 5.8
Additionally you'll need the following modules:

1. Requirements
================================================
Those should be included in your Perl distribution:
--------------------------------------------------
Getopt::Long
Config

While these modules you might have to install additionally using your 
distribution or cpan(1)
--------------------------------------------------
Net::FTP
Net::Netrc
Term::ReadKey
File::Temp
Cwd


And you only need these modules, if you would like to 
encrypt you backups (GnuPG) or hardlink them (rsync).
In order for them to work, you'll also need rsync and gnupg
--------------------------------------------------
GnuPG
File::Rsync



2. Installation
================================================
Once you have all dependencies installed, 
installation should be a simple matter of 
make
make install

By default this will install ftpbackup into /usr/local.
If you want it to be installed differently, export the environment
variable PREFIX. So to install everything in /usr you should do (bash assumed):
export PREFIX=/usr
make
install

You'll probably need root permissions to install into /usr, though.
