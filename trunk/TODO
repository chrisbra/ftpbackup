- enable FXP to allow backing up to a different ftp-server

- make use of ~/.netrc

- take care of permissions

- make script configurable using ~/.ftpbackuprc

- enable different storage methods. We are already using rsync, so how
  backing up to an rsync server?

- make debug levels configurable (using -v switch)

- make ftp-url parser more robust

- Rewrite using OO paradigma (%config is already used as object).


# Resolved items (hopefully ;)
- use gpg to encrypt files locally
- use rsync for hardlinking with backup directory
- parse ftp-URI for username/password
- signal handling (clean up temporary directory, when interrupted)
