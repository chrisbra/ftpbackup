ftpbackup (0.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * new release (0.4)
  * new feature: implements File Exchange Protocol. This allows to
    transfer data from one FTP server to another server, without
    storing the data on the system ftpbackup runs.
  * new feature: ftpbackup can make use of an existing .netrc
    to determine username and password. This way other users won't be
    able to detect your credentials when looking into the process
    list.
  * documentation updates
  * some small bugs have been fixed
  * by default print warnings, even if --debug has not been specified
  * improved signal handling. Before, old files may have left, in case
    ftpbackup has been interrupted.
  * svn-id: $Id: ftpbackup 66 2008-04-24 17:29:33Z cb $
  * changed compat level to 5
